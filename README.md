# TechInterviewPractice

This is done for my personal use and will progress as I have time. Any information will be as detailed as I feel is necessary to achieve a decent understanding of a particular problem or solution. Hopefully everything is correct. I make no promises.<br/>
Others can use it as they see fit.<br/>

Goal:<br/>
The goal of this project is to provide adequate material to assist in passing a technical interview using C#. 
<br/><br/>
Information:<br/>
-Math applications<br/>
-Algorithms<br/>
-Data Structures<br/>
-Design<br/>
-C# basics<br/>

<br/>
Examples:<br/>
-There will be C# programmed examples to pair with most, if not all, points found in Information.<br/>
-Inline comments will be entered in to break down the code as it relates to informational points.
