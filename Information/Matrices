Matrices can be used to solve problems similar in to the Fibonacci Sequence.

Definition:
Fibonacci Sequence: Is a series that can be defined as f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) where n > 1, f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1.
    Ex/ The first 10 numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Matrix: A collection of numbers arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns.
    Ex/ A matrix of basis R^2 (two dimensions) is equivalent to a 2D array
